## Description
Welcome to the DNAborhood - learn about genome sequencing through a fun, exciting, and extremely well-executed game and various interactive elements.

## Overview
* New game will randomly generate two strings, randomly hide characters in those strings and start you off with 4 guesses.
* Sounds hard? Fear not. The top string and bottom string are connected, just like real DNA.
* You win by filling in the spaces with available letters from the pool and guessing the correct sequence.
* Hover over the glowing green orbs on the page to learn more about the wonderful world of DNA!
